# Autotune
Implemented a phase vocoder-modified pitch-shifted algorithm on BELA. We have also extended the algorithm by adding two variations, smooth pitch shift, and partial pitch shift. We have also presented a detailed evaluation of the algorithm with two variations on two audio files. The detected fundamental/dominant frequency works efficiently for simpler audio files and is matched to the target frequency under different variations.
